              <p style="text-align: justify;">Hoa Lan Joint Stock Company has found a solution to the issue of sustainable development of its business before the storm of the global economic crisis after applying Made in Vietnam Finest Management Technology for just over two months. After the implementation, staff members started to enthusiastically support the business. The happiness of their work shines in the eyes of Hoa Lan employees, generating a positive energy that significantly raises the business’ productivity and quality. Raising the bar for thinking, employees are able to reduce operational costs while maintaining and growing profits by eliminating both tangible and intangible waste costs that result from employees’ inability to optimize their work. Employees with a positive outlook not only voluntarily complete their tasks well, but also actively and voluntarily support their coworkers at work and bring that positivity back to their homes.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">It can be said that Made in Vietnam Finest Management Technology will start to inspire and guide small and medium-sized pure Vietnamese manufacturing and service businesses in 2022. The golden ratio states that for a nation’s economy to be robust, there should be at most 80% of small businesses, 5% of large businesses, and the remainder made up of medium-sized businesses. Toothpicks and cotton swabs are examples of small goods that need to be held to a higher standard. Therefore, GKM’s Finest Management Technology has been expanding to small and medium-sized businesses, assisting organizations in succeeding professionally and thereby enhancing society by offering the best goods and services to displace imports and gradually exporting them abroad.</p>

The year 2023 is going to be turbulent. Will business change for the better to weather the storm, or will it change for the worse and problems mount? Vietnamese companies use this time to “patch the net to repair the boat” and fortify their foundation in order to continue “going out in the storm” and conquer the impending difficulty. In order to jointly carry out the mission of developing premium goods and services by Vietnamese people, for Vietnamese people, and for humanity, GKM Institute of Finest Management continues to diligently transfer technology to Vietnamese companies.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">MBV Network was created through the transmission and homogenization of Made In Vietnam Finest Management Gene system combined with the professional strengths of each member enterprise. MBV Network includes businesses owned by Vietnamese people, cooperate to close the value chain of Vietnamese products and services (R&amp;D, production, trading) thereby contributing to creating a strong internal force foundation to gradually help Vietnamese enterprises continuously improve the value of themselves, also escape the trap of middle ability and middle income, making practical contributions to the sustainable development of Vietnam and humanity.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Businesses with Vietnamese-branded goods and services that have been implementing some or all of the Made in Vietnam Finest Management Genome into their operations will be welcome in the first phase of the MBV Network. The MBV Network’s ability to collaborate, connect, and close the value chain of goods and services produced by the hands and minds of Vietnamese businessmen and employees is based on the fact that all of its member companies share the same Made in Vietnam, Made by Vietnam Finest Management Genome. MBV Network and GKM Institute of Finest Management will support member businesses as they expand the commercial supply chain for their goods and services in the future network, in addition to closing the final product chain.</p>

              </span></strong></span></h2>
              <p>Two Elite Education Programs are organized by GKM Edu in 2022, one for primary students and one for high school students. The program is based on Made in Vietnam Education Technology, which was developed by GKM Institute of Finest Management and GKM EDU and is protected by intellectual property rights both in Vietnam and internationally. The program improves lives, develops learners’ true abilities, and upholds traditional values. Three factors highlight how the Elite education program differs from other programs:</p>
              <p>First: Training method<br>
              Putting the student’s development first and using universal principles as the cornerstone, utilizing knowledge effectively in real-world situations is a goal of training methods.<br>
              Second: Test and evaluation<br>
              Based on their true learning potential and how much their original personality values have changed, students are evaluated.<br>
              Third: Coordination<br>
              In the program, parents and teachers work closely together. Parents receive training on how evaluations at school and at home operate. Parents agree to participate in the learning process and practice sessions at the training facilities of the educational program with the school. After three months of implementation, the program’s benefits are felt by both parents and students. Students start to understand how to apply their knowledge to various spatial contexts at home, school, and in society. Students’ connections to their families and communities are strengthened as a result of that connection.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q1: As a training and management consultant in the field of A Pure Vietnamese Management School, how do you rate the overall development situation of Vietnamese businesses/ organizations that you have encountered in the past during training and counseling?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A1</strong>: With the experience of training and advising thousands of Vietnamese businesses across 3 regions of the country during the past 10 years, to me, 2019 is a year of positive changes in the economy in general and the Vietnamese business community in particular.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, quite a lot of Vietnamese entrepreneurs and businesses have begun to have Tam The perception that they need to develop their business in depth. The most obvious evidence of this is that more and more entrepreneurs want to produce Made in Vietnam products, Made by Vietnam products for replacing imported goods; deeply participates in the global value chain. Business leaders have begun to understand that businesses can only have their own position when they have their own core values, real products and services, meeting the increasing and rigorous demands of the life.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, businesses have understood the true value of the Made in Vietnam Lean Management System (Pure Vietnamese Management), which is really the appropriate management system to support businesses to develop sustainably. Business leaders have also begun to understand the importance of building a management DNA for businesses according to the Made in Vietnam Lean Management School. I think that is a good sign, especially in the context of an open economy where every individual, business, organization must create for themselves the competitive advantages in management to survive and develop.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A2:</strong> If an enterprise wants to develop sustainably, it is necessary to develop both technology and management in parallel. If one of these two factors is weak, it is difficult to develop sustainably. Technology helps businesses create products that meet customers’ requirements and standards. To participate in the global value chain, businesses must build the platform and develop technology in accordance with their management practices, comply with and ensure international standards of product and service quality. Technology can be imported or transferred, however, it cannot be imported in a massive way without taking into account the specific management factors and in accordance with Vietnamese practices.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Management is different, management is a thing in society, formed by social characteristics, so it is specific to each individual and each country. Therefore, each enterprise must build its own scientific and unified management system at all levels, which is its own appropriate management DNA. In an enterprise, management is a determinant of the productivity of individuals and organizations, efficiency and sustainability, or in other words directly impacts the costs of products and services. This is also a decisive factor for the competitiveness in the market, helping businesses increase their ability to participate in the global value chain.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q3: In your opinion, how does the technology need to be set on an appropriate management foundation?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A3:</strong> The practice of Made in Vietnam Lean Management System in businesses in Vietnam helped me to realize that, modern technology is not always good but the most importantly thing is the suitableness and effective management. If businesses invest a lot of money to get good technology but do not have appropriate technology management methods, the efficiency brought back may not be commensurate with the investment costs. Vietnam has had a lot of painful lessons in the past about this where the machinery stuff of trillions have been abandoned, causing waste and huge loss of resources of businesses and the country. It is time for us to be aware of this.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q4: Could you give advice to businesses that at what time do businesses need to start building a management system that carries the lean DNA according to the Pure Vietnam Management School?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A4:</strong> I think that businesses need to start building a systematic management system right from the beginning of establishing businesses. That is expressed through the development philosophy of the business, the mission of the business, the vision of the business. From the very first steps, business owners must know what their business was born for and where they will go, what they will need to do to achieve those goals. Just like a boat crossing the ocean, the clearer the itinerary, the more prepared it is, the higher the ability to reach its destination. A good DNA will determine which businesses grow and grow sustainably according to the DNA operating system.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q5. How have GKM Lean Management Institute, GKM Vietnam Corporation&nbsp; built a DNA system for businesses under the Made in Vietnam Lean Management School?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A5:</strong> At GKM, to help businesses build a DNA management system according to the Made in Vietnam Lean Management School, we have designed 3 programs including: Made in Vietnam Lean CEO (for business leadership), Made in Vietnam EMO Lean (for middle managers), and FMO (for staff level). First, it is the CEOs who must change the perception and get the desire to perfect the company management system in a methodical manner. After that, we will transfer to CEOs the method of transplanting the DNA into the enterprises under the Made in Vietnam Lean EMO program.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the process that we, together with the businesses, build the company management DNA through the training of mid-level team, turning middle-level managers into middle-level managers, a key factor in DNA of an enterprise. During EMO training, we also accompany businesses to establish an internal training environment for businesses. As mentioned above, internal training is extremely important because only when enterprises have good internal training the DNA of management and technology systems of enterprises can be maintained and developed well. I think this is an effective way and businesses in Vietnam can fully cooperate with GKM Lean Institute to duplicate the DNA together.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">All of these training and consulting programs have been registered for intellectual property in Vietnam and internationally by GKM Vietnam Co., Ltd.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q6: How will the staff training (FMO) be supported by GKM?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A6:</strong> These people will be involved in the DNA of the businesses through daily work under the counseling and training programs of the GKM Lean Institute. At the same time, it is the EMOs we have trained that will train FMO employees in enterprise practice with us. In addition, with the goal of contributing to improving the quality of Vietnam’s human resources, in 2019, GKM Lean Institute, GKM Vietnam Corporation also completed a set of solutions to develop new human resources named “Working for real, developing real career”. The program “Working for real, developing real career” is not only for domestic businesses, this program is extended to apply successfully to businesses that send workers to work abroad (often called exported laborers or trainees). This is an effective solution to help employees effectively acquire practical experience in working abroad, creating a foundation for career development after returning home.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3247 aligncenter" src="https://gkm.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hai-Phong-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450"></p>
              <div id="attachment_3248" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3248 size-full" src="https://gkm.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hai-Phong-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"><p class="wp-caption-text">Practicing the process of implementing the programs “Working for real, developing real career” in enterprises that send workers to work abroad</p></div>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">TAM THE and Lean Thinking are introduced to employees right after graduation will help improve the quality of FMOs at businesses, helping businesses limit retraining of which new businesses and workers will have the same Made in Vietnam Lean Management DNA Generation for long-term and sustainable development.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Not only in Vietnam, the FMO training program in 2019 has also been recommended by Japanese universities for their students. After completing the programs in 2019, in 2020, up to the date we have also continued to receive orders from other universities. It is a praiseworthy result for us not only domestic enterprises but also international partners who have begun to recognize the value and appreciation of the intellectual products from the Made in Vietnam Lean Management System. Products of enterprises and intellectual property management products in Vietnam have gradually conquered and affirmed their position in the international arena.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q7: In 2019, “Digital economy” and “Digital Transformation” are the terms mentioned by the government and domestic enterprises a lot. What do you think about this trend?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A7:</strong> We think that in order to improve productivity, quality and sustainable development, digital transformation activities need to be based on a strong management foundation and in line with Vietnamese practices.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">From the perspective of Made in Vietnam Lean Management, digital transformation in Vietnam is the transformation of the management model according to the DNA of Made in Vietnam Lean Management, in which models of effective lean management methods will be the element factors of the digital transformation. When the members of the enterprises are unified by Tam The, self-training and being trained to improve the management capacity, mastering the use of Lean Management solutions, the digital transformation process will take place quickly and effectively. If we prioritize too much investment in hardware elements (machinery, equipment, robots, microelectronic control systems, etc.) and forget the human factor that is the most important factor needing to transformed during digital transformation it will be is a huge waste.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q8: In order to d</em><em>o digital transformation a</em><em>nd transform the management model suitable for the digital economy, in your opinion, what should Vietnamese enterprises prioritize to do?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A8</strong>: Through our own researches, and from the experience drawn from Lean Management consultancy training projects for businesses, we think that</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">First, businesses must build a Made in Vietnam Lean Management System in their businesses. This is the fundamental factor determining the success of digital transformation</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, on the basis of the Made in Vietnam Lean Management System, Vietnamese enterprises need to step by step (in part or in whole) reach the R&amp;D area in their fields in order to master the technology, create technologies that are suitable to the country ‘s practices and in line with the development objectives of the enterprises.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Third, the human element should always be at the forefront of the factors involved in building businesses, developing products and services that meet the legitimate needs of Vietnamese and international markets. Businesses need to have a well-established technology management system, must have many suitable people in accordance with the DNA of the business, sustainable development with the business.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Fourthly, enterprises need to make internal training (both management and technology) an indispensable item in all activities of the enterprises. It is impossible to have a good staff to develop the business without good internal training. This is extremely important.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Q9: What more has GKM Vietnam done in 2019 to support businesses in the field of internal training?</em></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A9:</strong> In addition to offline training programs at enterprise locations, GKM E-learning system was also launched in 2019. Besides promoting the strengths of E-learning technology, GKM E-learning also focuses on addressing actual needs of the business is internal training. Not only support businesses to get online lessons for studying and reviewing (reskill and upskill) in any space, any time that is appropriate, based on Made in Vietnam Lean Management solutions, GKM E-learning also supports businesses to build in-depth training content about their own technologies and management. Since then, internal training activities in the business have become easier and easier.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">We also select important issues, directly addressing the problems facing Vietnamese businesses such as Made in Vietnam Lean Management &nbsp;5S. In order to apply 5S, we have upgraded the Japanese 5S method to Made in Vietnam&nbsp; Lean Management 5S method (intellectual property registered), to solve problems of the traditional 5S method such as not maintaining, not implemented regularly. Made in Vietnam Lean Management &nbsp;5S has been implanted in the pure Vietnamese Lean Management System (Made in Vietnam) (https://elearning.gkm.vn/). Therefore, although newly launched, GKM E-learning has been well received and registered for use by many Vietnamese businesses. I always emphasize that, in the process of digital transformation, it is about changing ways of thinking, changing the management model towards increasing productivity, creating more and more Made in Vietnam, Made by Vietnam products and services should be prioritized.</p>
